== Welcome to Resume

Resume is basically a proof-of-concept toy project I designed to keep my online
resume up-to-date in our web-based professional world. I wanted it to be as sexy
as possible, and easy to use and redesign (CSS + unobtrusive AJAX).

For a fun jQuery experience, every items that get a "rank" attriute can be
sorted with just a little mouse drag-and-drop, and (almost) anything can be done
on the items page without any of those nasty page reloads.

I hope you try and enjoy it, feel free to extend it, it's GPL software (see
the ./LICENCE). It also comes packaged with sample graphics and CSS styles, feel
free to reuse, it's under creative commons (I also included the SVG sources,
enjoy).

== Getting started

1. make sure you have Rails installed and versions match and that you have
   textilize (RedCloth) installed
2. copy the project in target directory
3. run rake db:migrate
4. be sure to set the password in config/initializers/admin_password.rb
   (unless you want to keep the default : 'whatever')

There you are, all set and ready to go. Now you can :

5. run the server with script/server
6. visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the view
7. visit http://localhost:3000/login to log in as admin (remember your password)

If you need an exemple of automated deployment, you can checkout my "dreamhost"
branch, there's a Capfile and a config/deploy.rb there that knows a lot about
how to set an environment on DreamHost servers. It's password-free, so don't
be shy...

== Data structure

Fairly simple for now, there are twoo models :

Item
  title:string mandatory
  content:text optional
  rank:integer
  parent_id:integer
  belong_to parent:Item    (fk: parent_id)
  has_many  children:Items (fk: parent_id)

An Item is a versatile part of the resume, it can range from the very root title
to the very leaffy competence or past experience.
Items are organised in a tree-structure (parent / children) and ordered by rank.

Contact
  kind:string mandatory
  text:string mandatory
  rank:integer

A Contact stores an address, a phone number, an email, etc. to contact the
resume's owner.
Contacts are just ordered and that's all there is to them, really.
