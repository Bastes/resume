== Welcome to Resume

Resume is basically a proof-of-concept toy project I designed to keep my online
resume up-to-date in our web-based professional world. I wanted it to be as sexy
as possible, and easy to use and redesign (CSS + unobtrusive AJAX).

I hope you try and enjoy it, feel free to extend it, it's GPL software (see
LICENCE). It also comes packaged with sample graphics and CSS styles, feel free
to reuse, it's under creative commons (I also included the SVG sources, enjoy).

== Getting started

1. make sure you have Rails installed and versions match and that you have
   textilize (RedCloth) installed
2. copy the project in target directory
3. run rake db:migrate
4. be sure to set the password in config/initializers/admin_password.rb
   (unless you want to keep the default : 'whatever')

There you are, all set and ready to go. Now you can :

5. run the server with script/server
6. visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the view
7. visit http://localhost:3000/login to log in as admin (remember your password)

== Data structure

Fairly simple for now, there is but one model :

Item
  title:string mandatory
  content:text optional
  rank:integer
  parent_id:integer
  belong_to parent:Item    (fk: parent_id)
  has_many  children:Items (fk: parent_id)

Items are organised in a tree-structure (parent / children) and ordered by rank.
